        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William originated in Henderson, Nevada at the tender age of 0. He remained there for multiple years before starting his education at the renowned Ross Street Elementary School #11 in the great state of New Jersey. Here he gained moral clarity and beauty. Believe it or not, he was also baptized here. He then moved to Huntingtown, Maryland at the also tender age of 11, a place known for farming tobacco and government workers. Here William was able to continue life with his 4 younger siblings, from the rest of elementary school until his graduation from Huntingtown High School. William had many friends throughout his early life, including ex friends who are now enemies. Unfortunately, he turned down a large number of dates in favor of living in peace.

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently a student at Brigham Young University, William is studying Cybersecurity as a freshman. He is taking a very rigorous schedule consisting of 13 credits, for example Weightlifting and a class where he just gets free food. In high school he completed 11 AP classes, which is way too many cause some of them literally acomplished nothing for credit in college, he has so many elective credits, it just makes him seem like a nerd. However, it was useful to learn how to both push academically and have a life, because rest assured, William Bradley Parsons the 5th does have a life. A very very fun life. 
        <p>
        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number 1 interest of William is actually music. He loves going to concerts more than anything. His favorite concert ever was Dave Matthews, literally a life altering experience. He loves 90s rock, whatever Dave is, and Tyler, The Creator. This may confuse some, but its just the way it is. William also has an obsession with competitive swimming. He can talk for hours about the current names in competitive swimming, for example the ongoing short course worlds and all of the world records being broken. While William was not good enough to swim for BYU, his father was and it was passed through his blood. Watching clips to TYR pro meets is a daily activity for William. I dare you Spencer the TA, ask him about swimming.
